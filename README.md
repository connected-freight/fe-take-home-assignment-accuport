## Getting started

> IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended that you read the problem statement thoroughly before you jump straight into the code and follow the instructions especially on the documenting part :)

As GitHub does not allow the forking of public repos to private repos, what you need to do instead is to clone this repo into a new personal private repo.

### 1. Create a new private repo

When creating a new private repo in GitHub, name the repo any way you like (but preferably `fe-take-home-assignment-accuport` if you want to follow the instructions below as it is), set it to private, and **do not initialize the repository with anything**.

### 2. Clone this repo to your local filesystem

```
git clone https://github.com/connected-freight/fe-take-home-assignment-accuport.git fe-take-home-assignment-accuport
```

### 3. Add your remote and push

Assuming that you are using `fe-take-home-assignment-accuport` as your repo name:

```
cd fe-take-home-assignment-accuport
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/fe-take-home-assignment-accuport.git
git push origin main
```

Now you can work with it just like any other GitHub repo.

### 4. Setup development environment

#### Install development tools

The following tools are required:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. A TypeScript-compatible IDE (We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

#### Install project dependencies

```
npm install or yarn install
```

#### Run tests

```
npm run test or yarn test
```

## Submission

When you are ready to submit, push all of your changes, and add `nico@connectedfreight.com` and `jaenal@connectedfreight.com` as a collaborator to your repo for grading üòä

Best of luck üëç!
